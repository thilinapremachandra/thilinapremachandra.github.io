WordHarmony Portfolio Webpage
This is a README file for my WordHarmony portfolio webpage, a project that celebrates the beauty of language and cultural diversity by providing language alternatives for common greetings and special occasions. The webpage aims to showcase the richness of different language alternatives and promote inclusivity and appreciation for diverse linguistic expressions.

Theme
The theme chosen for the WordHarmony portfolio webpage revolves around the concept of unity in diversity. The design elements reflect a harmonious blend of colors, symbols, and cultural motifs, representing the interconnectedness of languages and cultures worldwide. The choice of fonts, imagery, and layout aims to create a visually engaging and culturally immersive experience for visitors.

Features
In addition to the language alternatives for common greetings and special occasions, I have implemented the following additional features to enhance the usability and interactivity of the webpage:

Dynamic Language Selection: The webpage allows users to select their preferred language from a list of available options. Upon selecting a language, the greetings and special occasion phrases dynamically update to reflect the chosen language. This feature enables users to explore and compare different language variations in real-time.

Responsive Design: The webpage is designed to be responsive and compatible with various screen sizes and devices. Whether accessed on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device, the layout and content adjust accordingly, providing a seamless experience for all users.

Language Search: To facilitate easy navigation and discovery, the webpage includes a search functionality specifically tailored for languages. Users can search for a specific language or keyword, and the webpage will display relevant results. This feature allows users to quickly find the language alternatives they are looking for.

Usage
To view the WordHarmony portfolio webpage locally, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. Alternatively, the webpage is deployed and accessible online at https://thilinapremachandra.github.io/

Feedback and Contributions
I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or contributions to further enhance the WordHarmony portfolio webpage. If you have ideas for improvements, encounter any issues, or would like to contribute language alternatives for greetings and special occasions in your native language, please feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request on the GitHub repository.
